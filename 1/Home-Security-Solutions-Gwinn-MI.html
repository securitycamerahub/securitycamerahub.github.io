Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
