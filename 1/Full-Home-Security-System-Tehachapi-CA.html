The implicit reason for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. However suicide assaulters are plainly not prevented by video cameras - and may even be drawn in to the television coverage cameras can guarantee - and the expense of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far surpasses the restricted benefits that the system might supply in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
