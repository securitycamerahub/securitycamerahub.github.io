<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
