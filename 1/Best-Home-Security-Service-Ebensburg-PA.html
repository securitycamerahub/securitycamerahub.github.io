<p>To assess reaction times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of five times, utilizing contact and motion sensors. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all.

The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies bring into question the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of permitting three or 4 free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, because they offer no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
