<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>With low plan expenses and the option to turn professional monitoring on and off, SimpliSafe uses reasonable security at an available price.
