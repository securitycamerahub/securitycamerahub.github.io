With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without problem. The IR lights at night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that it's more complicated than it ought to be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
