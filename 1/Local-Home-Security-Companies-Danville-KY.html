<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their quick reaction times and total flexibility. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was pretty darn and simple and easy smooth. Otherwise, this company uses a comparable feature-set as brand names like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is offered today, it's safe to state that the wireless systems are simply as good, if not much better, than the wired systems. Given all of the other benefits, it's easy to see why numerous individuals are picking this alternative. </p>
