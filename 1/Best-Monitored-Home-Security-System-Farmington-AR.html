The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. But suicide aggressors are plainly not hindered by video cameras - and may even be drawn in to the tv protection cameras can ensure - and the cost of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice spending plan - far exceeds the minimal benefits that the system may offer in examining attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
