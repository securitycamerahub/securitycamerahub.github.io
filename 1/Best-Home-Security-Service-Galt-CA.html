<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
