<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, informs, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Why bother getting that fancy alarm if you consistently leave the front door unlocked and have such dim lighting that a camera can't record a clear image anyway? Purchase good door locks and window locks, and make certain essential locations like entryways and the sales register are well-lit.</p>
