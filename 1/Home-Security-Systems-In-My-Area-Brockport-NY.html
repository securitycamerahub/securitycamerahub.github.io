<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency because it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro: As security system cameras go, the Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro is one of the very best-- and it will deal with the rest of your Vivint system. The small, black orb of a dome camera offers a better field of vision than its bullet equivalent. It's also more subtle, more durable types of security cameras on the marketplace.

This camera uses a wide array of features including a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I explained it as decidedly middle of the road.

<p>So why don't we rank ADT greater? In some methods, ADT annoys us. We see many growing companies branching out and attempting new things in the home security area. But ADT isn't keeping up.

Not to point out that the customer service experience differs widely depending on the dealership you choose. </p>
