<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
