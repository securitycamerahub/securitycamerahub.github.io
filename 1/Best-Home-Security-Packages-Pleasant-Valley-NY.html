<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more expensive for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
