<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
