<p>However, in any scenario where standard-definition camera are used, the quality is going to be poor since the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these gadgets is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TELEVISION lines but the results are the exact same); they generally record vertical and horizontal fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is generally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>When you aren't around, most intruders enter your home or business. The come during the day, when you're most likely to be at work or running errands.

We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
