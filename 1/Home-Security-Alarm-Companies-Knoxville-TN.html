When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

Many websites requiring alarm installations no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>

When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
