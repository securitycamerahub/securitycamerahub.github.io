<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I have actually ditched my Nest Cams given that they were bought by Google. Something all of us require to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually identified intruders or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Keep in mind that these sirens might violate local sound control laws, so examine ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. If recording video footage in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>

If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the sound might scare off would-be trespassers-- if you're lucky. However the police will not come up until you personally call them. </p>
