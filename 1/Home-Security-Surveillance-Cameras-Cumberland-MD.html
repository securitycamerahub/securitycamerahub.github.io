<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to ignore objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. If capturing video in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
