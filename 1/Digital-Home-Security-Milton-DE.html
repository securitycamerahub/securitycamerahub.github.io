The main claim to fame that wired security companies have is that the systems can be more reliable than a wireless system. Considering that the system is wired into your home, it does not require to rely on a wi-fi network in order to relay info. Instead of utilizing wi-fi, a wired system works like a landline.</p>

For someone looking for a more complicated setup like home automation, or somebody that wants a trained expert to make the recommendation for the setup, professional installation is a fantastic choice.

They're powered by AA batteries which can obviously last 2 years. Regrettably, due to time restrictions, I wasn't able to put that claim to the test.</p>
