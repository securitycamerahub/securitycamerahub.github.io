<p>Condominium associations may forbid residents from drilling holes in exterior walls. Homeowners of these homes may be better off using a wireless security system.

<p>Select specific functions that match your scenario. For instance, if you experience frequent power blackouts, a security system that uses battery back-up would be a practical option.
