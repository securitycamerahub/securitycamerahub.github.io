<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
