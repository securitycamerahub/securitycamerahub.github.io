<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment prices is extremely sensible, so it's not a total splurge.
