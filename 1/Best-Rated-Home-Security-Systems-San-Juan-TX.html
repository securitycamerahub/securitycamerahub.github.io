<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are practically identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are a little more expensive for the same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation charges are difficult, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>

For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is tape-recorded.
