Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy choice. Sure, you get a lower rate if you choose a three-year agreement, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So pick what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the contract and gain those savings if you understand you'll remain put for at least 3 years. However if you may update to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best option.</p>
