<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
