<p>The wireless network is after all restricted to a small geographical location.

<p>Any clever security system worth its salt uses components that interact in a seamless environment and can be controlled utilizing tailored rules. For example, you can create rules to have the lights switch on when motion is discovered, have your doors unlock when a smoke detector goes off, and have a camera begin tape-recording when a sensing unit is set off. Some systems save taped video locally on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others offer cloud storage.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security since it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
