With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.
