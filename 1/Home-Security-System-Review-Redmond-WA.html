<h3>Best Home Security Service Providers in Washington</h3>

<p>Are independently owned, ran surveillance cameras to be treated the exact same method as public cameras? We also need to draw great lines about 'Who actually is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom could not do. They could peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing seeing outside a window it might be a criminal offense, yet the same individual might put a surveillance camera then from another location view a person within the personal privacy of their home.
