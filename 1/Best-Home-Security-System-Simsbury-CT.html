We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
