<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see precisely when a specific individual arrives at your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has broadened its security variety with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to launch a clever smoke detector and siren later this year, that makes this an even better proposition.</p>
