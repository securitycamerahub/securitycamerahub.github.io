<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
