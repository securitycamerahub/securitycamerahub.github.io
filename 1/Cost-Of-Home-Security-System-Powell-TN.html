<p>Various kinds of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were simple to install. Each camera has an app that walks you through the setup procedure. This typically involves finding an area for your camera, creating an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it since its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
