<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
