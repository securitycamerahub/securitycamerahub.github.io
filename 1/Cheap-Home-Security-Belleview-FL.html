<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notices and live views were painfully slow, and the range is poor.
