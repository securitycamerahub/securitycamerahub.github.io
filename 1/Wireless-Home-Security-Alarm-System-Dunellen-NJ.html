<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion.
