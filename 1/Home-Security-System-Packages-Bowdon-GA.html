<p>Sensors are an important foundation of any contemporary home security system.

Commercial-grade cameras are created and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Typically, consumer-grade cameras are constructed to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and as soon as the lighting becomes low or absent (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal. Due to the fact that they have bigger internal video sensors and higher-quality elements that can adapt and catch excellent low light video, commercial cameras outperform their less expensive cousins.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop alerts (and recording, given that it does that even when notices are off). We also experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months.</p>
