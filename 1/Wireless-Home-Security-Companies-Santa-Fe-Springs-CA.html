<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
