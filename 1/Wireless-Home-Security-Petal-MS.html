<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency given that it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it catches a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors.
