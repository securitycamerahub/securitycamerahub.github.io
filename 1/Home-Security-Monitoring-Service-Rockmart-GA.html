<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it records a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor.

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
