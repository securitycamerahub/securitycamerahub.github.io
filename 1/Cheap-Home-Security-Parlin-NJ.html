The app is great and slick, matching the camera's own cool design, and you can control the Circle via Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or one of Logitech's Pop wise home buttons.</p>

When buying a video recorder, you must initially make sure that the gadget will deal with the cameras you've acquired. If you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras need to have the ability to supply you with the necessary details.</p>
