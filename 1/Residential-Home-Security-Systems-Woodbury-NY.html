<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those people and will send out smart device informs with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
