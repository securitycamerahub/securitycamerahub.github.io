<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.
