<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. But suicide attackers are clearly not discouraged by camera - and might even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the restricted advantages that the system may provide in examining attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
