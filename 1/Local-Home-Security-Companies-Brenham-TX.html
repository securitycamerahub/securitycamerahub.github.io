A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system linked together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing dependable video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we created security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're reinventing the wise home. Firsts like Blue are what we do. Considering that they're so clearly recognizable as a security camera, they're a terrific deterrent also, and they're easy to mount almost anywhere. With the normal weatherproof hoods, they're rather long lasting, but they don't constantly come with the complete IP accreditation of other models.</p>
