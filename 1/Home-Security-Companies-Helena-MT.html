<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out mobile phone informs with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
