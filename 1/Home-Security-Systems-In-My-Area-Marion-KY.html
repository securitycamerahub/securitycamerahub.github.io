<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. You do not have to purchase a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your property and ownerships.

<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disturbance concept based on two unshielded (or 'leaky') coaxial cables buried around 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter emits constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is gotten by the other cable television.
