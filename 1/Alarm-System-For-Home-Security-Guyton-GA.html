<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially cutting-edge, so we're actually recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower cost if you go with a three-year agreement, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So select what will be the much better deal for you. If you know you'll sit tight for a minimum of 3 years, go with the agreement and gain those cost savings. However if you may upgrade to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best option.</p>
