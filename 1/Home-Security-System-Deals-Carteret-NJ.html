<p>While every property owner stresses over burglaries, apprehension has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces frequently leading to false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system linked together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing trustworthy video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years back, we invented security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're reinventing the smart home. Firsts like Blue are what we do.
