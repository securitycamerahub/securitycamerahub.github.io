<p>Note: The above CCTV camera types only touch the IP camera world and overlook the old analog cameras, given that everyone prefers IP cameras today for their economical prices, functions and simple setup.

A lot of alarm companies that will install a consumer security system usually charge a $99 installation cost plus regular monthly monitoring costs.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency considering that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
