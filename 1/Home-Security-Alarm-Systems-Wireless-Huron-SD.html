Installation can be complicated - specifically if your home has already been developed - so make certain to talk to a professional prior to taking on the task yourself.

When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, again based on whether the design is generally open or usually closed. This action coupled with an electric current (usually at 12V DC) permits an alarm control board to spot a fault on that zone or circuit.
