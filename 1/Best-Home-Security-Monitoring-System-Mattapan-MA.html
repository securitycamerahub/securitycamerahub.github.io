<h3>Home Security Provider in Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the maker's stats since this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest offender for short battery life by far.

<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered an information breach, however we concur with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we do not believe that these problems modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our current suggestion.</p>
