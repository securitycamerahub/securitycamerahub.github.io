<p>The greatest drawback of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensor gets set off while you're away, you have no visual means of confirming if something is really incorrect and how major the circumstance is. If the alarm incident is determined to be an incorrect alarm, the city will send by mail an invoice summing up the incident and examining a fee, if any.</p>
