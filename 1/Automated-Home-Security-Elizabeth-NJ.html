<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single interface, a detailed understanding of all the needed systems is necessary.

The very first alternative, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is unwilling or unavailable to supply those information) and document the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other method is to replace and rip, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
