<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and general motion.
