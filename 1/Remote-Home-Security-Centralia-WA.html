<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
