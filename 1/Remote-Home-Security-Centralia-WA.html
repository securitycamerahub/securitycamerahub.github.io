<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
