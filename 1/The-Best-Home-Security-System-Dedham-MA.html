<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are practically similar to those of the Brinks system.

<p>A self-monitored system should be clever. It ought to have the capability to follow rules with cause-and-effect relationships between different devices.
