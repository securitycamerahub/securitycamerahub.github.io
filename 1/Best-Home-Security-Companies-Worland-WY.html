<p>Wireless cameras can be an exceptional option for a video surveillance system. There are a few things to think about prior to choosing a wireless alternative, one being what type is going to be the most beneficial.

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
