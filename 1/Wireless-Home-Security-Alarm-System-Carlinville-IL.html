<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire household will like. However for everybody who likes ADT, it looks like there's someone who's had an awful experience. Part of that is since ADT has more customers than the majority of brands-- which indicates it has more possibilities to face issues. But part of it is the way ADT sells its equipment. When a company deals with multiple dealers and companies, its consumers are going to get a broad variety of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement might be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems generally don't come with upfront charges. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
