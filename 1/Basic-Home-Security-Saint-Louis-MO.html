A few of the more common ones are bullet cameras, which are the rectangular boxes you might see protruding from a wall; dome cameras, which are frequently attached to a ceiling and housed in a tinted cover; and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras, which use remote-control capabilities to change the field of view.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors.
