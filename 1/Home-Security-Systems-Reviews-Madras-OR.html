<p>For these different systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, an in-depth understanding of all the needed systems is required. If there are no as-built documents providing performance and setup info to make this integration work, there are just two alternatives. The very first choice, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is not available or unwilling to offer those details) and document the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other technique is to rip and replace, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If capturing video in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>

In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is seldom a stand-alone system. It is worth knowing if your proposed camera system will incorporate with other products. </p>
