<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the porch by a certified electrician (who occurs to be my other half).

<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey however is vital. In fact, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to add the subscription.
