<p>The other major decision when choosing a home security camera is whether you require an outdoor or indoor camera. Outdoor cameras will frequently be developed to be more able and resilient to survive rain, frost, or damp. The downside of outdoor cameras is that they're typically mains powered and require expert installation. Thankfully, I have actually evaluated out dozens of cameras and condensed everything I've discovered into the list below.

Where some choices, like ADT, have good equipment but so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have some of the best functions on the market, including video analytics and 4K image sensors (as well as more standard fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>

For example, two-thirds of D.C.'s police surveillance cameras were attacked by hackers days before the 2017 presidential inauguration as part of a ransomware attack, triggering more than 100 of the cameras to go dark.</p>
<p>One of the most crucial features of doorbell cameras is that they can interface with your mobile phone through an app, allowing you to see and respond to occasions at your door whether you're home or not.

<p>While you need to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more budget-friendly subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month.

Lots of sites requiring alarm installations no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with standard telephone dialer ability do not work dependably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
