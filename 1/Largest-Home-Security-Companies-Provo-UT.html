<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to disregard items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires.
