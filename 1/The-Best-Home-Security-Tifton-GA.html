<p>We attempted each of the cameras in multiple places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera utilizing an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smart device (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a variety of equipment and home automation products at a reasonable price, the one area where the company especially excels is in DIY installation. </p>
