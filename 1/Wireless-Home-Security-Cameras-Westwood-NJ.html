<h2>Cameras For Home Video Surveillance Systems Westwood</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, spanning a number of decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually evolved into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems readily available today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and watch it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

Or, you may require different kinds of sensors such as those that monitor ecological disasters and other household threats like fire and carbon monoxide gas, and so on. Or maybe you are a senior and want to include a medical alert button and the associated equipment to your security system.</p>
