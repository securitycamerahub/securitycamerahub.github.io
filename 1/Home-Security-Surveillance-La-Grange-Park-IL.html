<p>A number of other designs were disqualified due to performance issues. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
