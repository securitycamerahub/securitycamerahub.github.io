<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.

We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
