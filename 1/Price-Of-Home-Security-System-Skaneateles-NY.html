<p>While every homeowner frets about break-ins, uncertainty has actually surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complicated agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces often resulting in false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system linked together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing trusted video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we invented security and alarm monitoring services. Today, we're transforming the clever home. Firsts like Blue are what we do.

Thankfully, I have actually tested out dozens of cameras and condensed whatever I've learned into the list listed below.
