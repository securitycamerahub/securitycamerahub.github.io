All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such events. Nevertheless, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide.

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions.

Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If recording video in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their quick reaction times and total flexibility. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was simple and easy and pretty darn sleek.

Offered all of the other advantages, it's simple to see why many people are picking this choice. </p>
