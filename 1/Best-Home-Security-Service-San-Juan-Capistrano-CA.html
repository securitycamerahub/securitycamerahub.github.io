It's easy to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be installed practically anywhere indoors. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be utilized as an intercom; and it interacts with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, along with various third-party smart- home gadgets.

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to discuss that the customer service experience varies extensively depending upon the dealership you choose. </p>
