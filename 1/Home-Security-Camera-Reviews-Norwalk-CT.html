<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the basics. But while ADT systems work with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems don't. This seriously limits your options for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party wise home devices like lights, outlets, locks, and thermostats. If you already have a security gadget from another brand name, like a Blink XT camera, it probably will not work with your SimpliSafe system.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

We were particularly pleased with the customizability alternatives. Clients can select anything from basic monitoring to full-on home security automation, with the ideal mix of services and devices to fit their needs. </p>
