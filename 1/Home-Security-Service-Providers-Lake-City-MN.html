<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.

<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even set off incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they occur often enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the reality that there are no installation expenses.</p>
