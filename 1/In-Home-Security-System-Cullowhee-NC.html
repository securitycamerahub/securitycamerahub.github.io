<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face recognition software. The latter allows you to see exactly when a specific person comes to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has actually expanded its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to release a clever smoke detector and siren later this year, which makes this an even much better proposition.</p>
