<p>While every house owner worries about break-ins, suspicion has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces frequently resulting in false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system linked together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing reliable video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we created security and alarm monitoring services.
