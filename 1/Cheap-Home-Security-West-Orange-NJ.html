There are just 2 alternatives if there are no as-built files providing functionality and setup information to make this integration work. The very first alternative, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial option provider is reluctant or unavailable to provide those details) and record the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and change, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
