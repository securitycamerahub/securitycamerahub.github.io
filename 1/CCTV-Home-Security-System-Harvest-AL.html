<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more costly for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
<p>You'll get updated equipment from Link Interactive and a highly-rated mobile app. Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive offers up to 48 sensing units in its basic plan, including both fire and CO alarms.

However if your primary objective is keeping criminals out of your house and safeguarding your residential or commercial property, you don't need to invest a package.</p>

Frontpoint's detectors are immune to pets weighing approximately 40 pounds. With ADT, the professional installer can customize the level of sensitivity level based on your pet's size. </p>
