<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for further wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
