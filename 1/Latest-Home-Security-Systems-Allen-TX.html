<p>Naturally, the apparent drawback to a wired security system is that the initial install can be expensive. If the system was not installed throughout the homebuilding process, setting one up might require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and getting to hard spots that are sealed off in attics or basements. Wired security systems are also susceptible to power outages. Most will have a backup battery system that switches on in case of an interruption, but long term interruptions will lead to the system losing power. It's also essential to think about the length of time you prepare to stay at the very same residence when picking a wired system. Because these security systems are incorporated into the home's electrical wiring, they are not portable and can't move with you.</p>

<p>The Ring Floodlight Webcam combines 2 important devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera identifies motion, it switches on its two powerful LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording. The Floodlight Web cam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk with whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their reactions.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

It can compare general motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually labeled (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
