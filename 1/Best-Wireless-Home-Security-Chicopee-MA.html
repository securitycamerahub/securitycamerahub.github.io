When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it catches a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors.

Wireless cameras can't have all of it-- view things inside by day, and keep an eye on what's going on outside after dark. It hardly ever works.</p>
