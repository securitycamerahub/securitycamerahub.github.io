<p>When portability and movement are essential to house owners, wireless systems have a definite advantage, considering that they can be removed easily and reinstalled quickly. With no drilling or complex electrical circuitry to be done, wireless systems typically do not require professional installation, and since they don't need a labor-intensive and substantial elimination of wires, they can be moved relatively easily, a definite benefit for tenants and individuals on the go. It's a flexible form of security technology, due to the fact that sensors can be moved and added with relative ease.
