<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
