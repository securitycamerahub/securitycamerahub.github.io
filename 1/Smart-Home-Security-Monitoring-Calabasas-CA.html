Numerous insurance companies use discount rates on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments offer a number of "free" false alarms before enforcing any fine, even though the cost to respond is considerable right from the start.

The first option, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is reluctant or unavailable to supply those information) and document the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and change, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
