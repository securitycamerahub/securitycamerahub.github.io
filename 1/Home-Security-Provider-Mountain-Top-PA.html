For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent alternative for long variety situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition.

We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
