<p>In the modern day, with our rampant internet use, we have actually become surprisingly lackadaisical in our approach to home security. Just believe just how much information you hand out when you do a basic online grocery order: your name, your address, the kind of things you buy, what times you'll be around (and, by extension, what times you'll be out). You might even give guidelines on how to enter your structure.</p>

<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to third party companies? I have actually ditched my Nest Cams because they were purchased by Google. Something all of us require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has actually detected burglars or wild animals.

Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
