<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. If capturing video in the dark is a concern, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
