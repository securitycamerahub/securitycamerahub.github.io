<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
