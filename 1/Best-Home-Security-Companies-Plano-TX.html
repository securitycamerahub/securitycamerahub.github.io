The clever bit is that the camera not only identifies that people have actually entered its 130-degree field of vision, but it will also have a stab at acknowledging them too.

You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should immediately know.</p>

<p>Recording the video footage from your security cameras needs hard disk drives or cloud based storage. If you have an analog security camera system, then the digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are connected to has a hard disk drive within it.

<p>Frontpoint offers 5 packages and two monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester opted for the Interactive plan but ended up disappointed with its absence of live video surveillance.
