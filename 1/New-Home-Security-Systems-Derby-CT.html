<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to third party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something we all require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has actually spotted burglars or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Keep in mind that these sirens may breach local noise control laws, so check ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>

<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it means you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply. It also suggests that if you in fact saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could rapidly record a message to him or her through your smartphone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you picture, would be enough to send even the most dedicated career criminal scampering empty-handed down the road. </p>
