<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. All of the cameras were easy to install. Each camera has an app that strolls you through the setup process. This generally includes discovering a spot for your camera, developing an account in the app, and linking the camera to your Wi-Fi network. Many of them then allow you to set up the alert frequency and develop activity monitoring zones, so the camera will record motion only in designated areas-- a function we find necessary for high-traffic locations, which could trigger a lot of false informs.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually described as shock sensing units, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>

We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly. It's also worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
