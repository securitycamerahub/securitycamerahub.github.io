<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious assaulter, considering that the disturbance of the network prevents the flow of data and in fact indirectly protects data by avoiding it from being sent. The typical factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the destructive aggressor to tape these codes and utilize numerous cracking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
