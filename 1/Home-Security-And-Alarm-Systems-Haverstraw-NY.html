As with any criminal offense, the lawbreakers are getting more advanced and are discovering new ways to get what they desire. From new gadgets that can jam the radio signal and prevent the alarm from responding to taking passwords to disarm the system; sly thieves never stop trying.</p>
<p>When you get a wireless self monitored alarm, be sure to keep the base device in a central place so all the various gadgets are in close distance to it.
