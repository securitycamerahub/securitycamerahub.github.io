<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smartphone informs with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
