<p>A self-monitored home security system counts on the homeowner to view their home and contact cops in the event of an emergency situation. A self-monitored system does not imply a property owner needs to sacrifice any functions.

The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
