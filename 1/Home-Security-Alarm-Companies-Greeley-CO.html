<p>While you have to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more economical memberships out there at $2.99 a month.

Lots of websites requiring alarm setups no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with standard telephone dialer capability do not work reliably over some types of VoIP service.</p>
