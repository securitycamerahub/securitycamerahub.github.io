The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost 2 years of night, day and use images have constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, a problem we came across when evaluating the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered.

What good is a surveillance camera that only works preferably in ideal conditions like intense sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in particular circumstances such as nanny cameras or checking in on an animal, though when seeking to collect proof of a crime they frequently come up short.</p>
