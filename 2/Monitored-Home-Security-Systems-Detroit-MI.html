<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more pricey for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyway.</p>
<p>When the alarm company agent has made an appraisal of your security needs, ask him for a composed proposition and a copy of the agreement you will have to sign. Take a while, look it over, and consider it. Inspect the alarm company's reputation by calling the Better Business Bureau, or calling the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation or the Alarm Association of Florida.
