Modern systems now have phenomenal capabilities", though these have actually developed easy to understand misgivings about the danger for privacy and prospective abuse such abilities produce.

<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you purchase a monitored security strategy, the very same company that keeps an eye on the system will install it for you. If you're not mechanically inclined, having an expert established the system may give you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself. Wireless cameras can't have everything-- enjoy things inside by day, and keep an eye on what's going on outside after dark. It rarely works.</p>
