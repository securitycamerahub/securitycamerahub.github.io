<p>However, in any circumstance where standard-definition camera are utilized, the quality is going to be poor due to the fact that the optimum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TV lines but the results are the exact same); they usually catch horizontal and vertical fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the maximum frame rate is usually 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>With an analog system, coax cable is needed for transmitting video footage from the CCTV security cameras.

In many cases, the company is able to offer professional installation services the same day.</p>
