When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
