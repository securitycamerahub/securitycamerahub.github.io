<p>Everything about Security provides professional, trusted alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the higher Indianapolis area. The advanced cameras in the market enable two-way audio between people on either side of the video surveillance system.

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it since its battery-saving regimens can disrupt performance.</p>
