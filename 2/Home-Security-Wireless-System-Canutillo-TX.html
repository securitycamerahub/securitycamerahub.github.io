<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security since it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
