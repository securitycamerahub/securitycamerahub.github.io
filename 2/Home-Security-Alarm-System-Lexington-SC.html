<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly tried to offer it an appealing edge, and we have to provide credit to its ability to show what's going on from as much as 4 cameras at a time. It can be sluggish and awkward to use on celebration - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you wish to conserve some cash - it does have actually a cable attached though, instead of working wirelessly, which means it's a bit much easier to sabotage for possible burglars.
