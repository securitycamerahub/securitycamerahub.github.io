<p>Even though 1080p is typically the standard resolution for cameras we've checked, there are benefits to designs with higher-resolution sensors. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things plainly.</p>
