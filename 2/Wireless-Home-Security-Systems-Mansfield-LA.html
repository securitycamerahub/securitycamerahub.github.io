<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires.
