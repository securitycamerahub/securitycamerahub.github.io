<p>Mix of Man and Device: People should be out on the streets and work-places trying to prevent criminal activity or losses.

<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
