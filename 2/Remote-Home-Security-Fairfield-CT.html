<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
