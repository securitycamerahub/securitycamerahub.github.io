<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are practically identical to those of the Brinks system.

<p>The primary intent of the law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies and their clients more liable for false alarms, and reduce the number of unnecessary cops and fire reactions. When responding to unintended or incorrect alarms, the fees balance out the expenses to the Seattle Authorities and Fire Departments.

It costs a lot, its prices isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to mention that the customer care experience differs widely depending upon the dealership you go with. </p>
