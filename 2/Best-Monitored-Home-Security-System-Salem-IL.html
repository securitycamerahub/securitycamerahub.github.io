It's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you might call to mind when you think of a home security camera.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security crucial caught during the network healing.</p>
