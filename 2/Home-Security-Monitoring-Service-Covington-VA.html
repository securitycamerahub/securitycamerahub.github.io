<p>Home security systems and modern clever home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to tap into their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone. Commercial properties tend to have even greater incorrect alarm rates than homes because more people tend to share responsibility for activating and shutting down the alarm systems, and the systems tend to be more complex.
