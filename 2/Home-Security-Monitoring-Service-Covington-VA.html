<p>Home security systems and modern clever home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to tap into their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone. Commercial properties tend to have even greater incorrect alarm rates than homes because more people tend to share responsibility for activating and shutting down the alarm systems, and the systems tend to be more complex. The rate of incorrect alarms for commercial alarm users may be as much as three times greater than the rate of false alarms amongst residential alarm users. 9 Chronic incorrect alarm activations are frequently due to inadequate staff member training or inferior systems that have not been upgraded.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it because its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
