<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition.

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
