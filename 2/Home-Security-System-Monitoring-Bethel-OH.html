<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are a little more expensive for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are onerous, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
<p>Throughout the spring and summer season, home security or alarm companies work with taking a trip sales representatives to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "cold calls" on property owners. In many cases, the salesmen usage deceptive or high-pressure sales methods to get potential clients to buy expensive, and often substandard, systems or equipment they don't require.</p>
<p>So why don't we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT frustrates us. We see numerous growing companies branching out and attempting new things in the home security area. However ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its rates isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to mention that the customer care experience varies widely depending upon the dealership you go with. </p>
