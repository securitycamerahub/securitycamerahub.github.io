<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
