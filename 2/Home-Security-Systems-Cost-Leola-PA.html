<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more costly for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are difficult, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
