<p>I have this camera hooked up to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night have the ability to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like.

<p>Flood lights are typically used in conjunction with motion detectors.

<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, because it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio.
