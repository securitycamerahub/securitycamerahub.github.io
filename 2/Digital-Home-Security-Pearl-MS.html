<p>Fleenor uses wireless monitoring for their alarm. Monitoring contracts are readily available at 36 months. Much of the major home security systems now offer video doorbells of their own, and some deal compatibility with standalone video doorbells and keypads like these, too. If you believe you might desire to broaden to a full system later on down the line, keep that in mind.</p>

<p>For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system.

Alexa support is included, as you would anticipate from an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera properly deals with all the usual functions when it comes to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights head out. </p>
