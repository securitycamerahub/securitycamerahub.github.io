It is necessary to buy equipment that can withstand your local climate condition, be that extreme heat, cold, or wetness. Cameras are also exposed to anybody who approaches your home, so you must consider how your video feed is secured from vandals smashing the camera.

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

In many cases, the salesmen use high-pressure or deceptive sales tactics to get possible customers to buy expensive, and in some cases substandard, systems or equipment they do not need.</p>
