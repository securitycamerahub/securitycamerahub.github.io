<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency since it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
