<h3>Residential Security Cameras Punta Gorda FL 33950</h3>
<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more expensive for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
