<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
