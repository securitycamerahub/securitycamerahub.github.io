<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency given that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
