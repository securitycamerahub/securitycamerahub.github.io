When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
