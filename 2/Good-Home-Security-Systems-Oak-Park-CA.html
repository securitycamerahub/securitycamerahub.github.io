<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those individuals and will send out mobile phone signals with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
