<p>Bullet cameras are one of the 2 most common CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, providing their name and a distinct appearance. This look is identifiable to almost everyone and hence acts as a deterrent to undesirable people. The hope is burglars and crooks go somewhere else instead if security cameras are visible.
