Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
