<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a community feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur.

Rules such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>

These people are $18 a month cheaper and stayed in business 3 years so I'm comfortable providing a try. When my dealer folded, Dream I had looked earlier but frankly didnt realize I could save money up until required to look.</p>
