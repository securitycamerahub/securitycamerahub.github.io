As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
