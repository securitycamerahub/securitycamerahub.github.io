<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
