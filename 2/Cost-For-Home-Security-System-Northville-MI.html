<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very typical type of 2 piece sensing unit that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either typically open or normally closed when under the impact of an electromagnetic field as in the case of proximity to the 2nd piece which includes a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, once again based on whether or not the design is usually open or generally closed. This action coupled with an electrical current (typically at 12V DC) permits an alarm control board to find a fault on that zone or circuit.
