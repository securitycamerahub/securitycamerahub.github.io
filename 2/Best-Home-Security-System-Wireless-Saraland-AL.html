<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit reason for the current push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide assailants are clearly not hindered by camera - and might even be attracted to the tv coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the restricted advantages that the system may provide in examining attacks or tried attacks after the reality (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.
