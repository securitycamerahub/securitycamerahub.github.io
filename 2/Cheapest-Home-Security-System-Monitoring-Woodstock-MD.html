<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. You don't have to purchase a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your residential or commercial property and belongings.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensing units, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
