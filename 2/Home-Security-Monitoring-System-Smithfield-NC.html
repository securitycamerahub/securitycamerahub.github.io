<p>For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment in this manner to make consumers stay with them longer, because switching monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers. Alexa assistance is included, as you would expect from an Amazon-owned brand, and the camera effectively deals with all the typical functions when it pertains to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights head out. </p>
