<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be established both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is extremely reasonable, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

The good news is that prices are boiling down, and you can get a quality model for around $20! However, you can't actually put a cost on peace of mind.</p>
