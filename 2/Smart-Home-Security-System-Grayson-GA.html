<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a kind of CCTV camera with a dome cover. But beyond that I simply had issues. The switch from daytime to night vision took about five minutes (though it worked fine changing from night to day.) The motion detector is bad. I was carrying out the macarena in front of the camera for about two minutes prior to it even discovered I existed. </p>
