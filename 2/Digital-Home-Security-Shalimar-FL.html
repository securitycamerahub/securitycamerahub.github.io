<p>One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which might be a budget friendly choice for customers in rural areas. We suggest cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, however there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't offered.

Lots of sites needing alarm setups no longer have standard telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer ability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
