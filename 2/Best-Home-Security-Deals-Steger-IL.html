When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which suggests. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm.
