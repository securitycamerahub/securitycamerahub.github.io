<p>We have actually all heard that old stating, you get what you spend for". If you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the expense.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a house owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a neighborhood cat, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>

The system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
