<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. You do not need to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your home and belongings. In case your alarm system is set off, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security specialists are standing by to respond by immediately getting in touch with you and if need be, the local medical, fire or police authorities.</p>

When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

Likewise a local alarm won't get in touch with the authorities; it merely triggers an audible siren to alert people close by.</p>
