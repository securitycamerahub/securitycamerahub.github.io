<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
