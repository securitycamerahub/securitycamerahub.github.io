<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room.

We likewise discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
