When a user turns on a computer and it locks on to a wireless access point from a surrounding company's overlapping network, the user may not even understand that this has actually taken place.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in several places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera utilizing an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint provides a variety of equipment and home automation items at an affordable rate, the one location where the company particularly stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
