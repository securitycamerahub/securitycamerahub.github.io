<p>The Ring Floodlight Web cam combines two necessary devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
