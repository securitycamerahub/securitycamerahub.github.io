<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't simply for catching a burglar in the act, though. They're likewise beneficial for casual home monitoring. Placed on tables, counter tops, and racks, they enable you to watch on what your animals are doing, understand when the kids get back from school, or discover who's been hitting the liquor cabinet. Most even enable you to communicate with whoever is on-camera as the action is occurring, via an ingrained microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>You'll get up-to-date equipment from Link Interactive and a highly-rated mobile app. Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive supplies as much as 48 sensing units in its basic bundle, including both fire and CO alarms. If smart home security is what you're after, we recommend checking out Vivint or ADT prior to getting on the cheaper, DIY bandwagon. But if your primary objective is keeping bad guys out of your house and securing your residential or commercial property, you don't need to invest a bundle.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send smart device signals with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
