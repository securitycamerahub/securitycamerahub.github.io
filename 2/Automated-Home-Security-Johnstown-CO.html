<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm system, a number of companies use "free monitoring services" for the very first couple of months. Many insurer use discounts on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments offer several "free" incorrect alarms before imposing any fine, although the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the current pattern in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or four complimentary incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front rewards to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>

Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of specific sensing units or groups.  High-end systems enable multiple access codes, and might even permit them to be used only as soon as, or on particular days, or just in mix with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied). In any case, a remote monitoring center ought to set up an oral code to be supplied by an authorized person in case of incorrect alarms, so the monitoring center can be assured that a further alarm response is unneeded. As with access codes, there can also be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for furnace repairperson to go into the kitchen and basement sensor areas but not the silver vault in the kitchen. There are also systems that permit a pressure code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still trigger the remote alarm to summon the police to a burglary.</p>
