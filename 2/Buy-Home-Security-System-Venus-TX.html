You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should automatically understand.</p>

<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to ignore things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
