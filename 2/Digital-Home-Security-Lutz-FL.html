<p>Identity theft (or MAC spoofing) takes place when a hacker is able to eavesdrop on network traffic and identify the MAC address of a computer system with network advantages The majority of wireless systems enable some sort of MAC filtering to enable only licensed computers with particular MAC IDs to gain access and make use of the network.

<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
