<p>Likewise called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you precisely reroute the field of vision without remounting the security camera each time. They're terrific for warehouses.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send smartphone alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
