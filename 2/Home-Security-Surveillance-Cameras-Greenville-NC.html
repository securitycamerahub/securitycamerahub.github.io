Incorrect alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they occur frequently enough.

This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
