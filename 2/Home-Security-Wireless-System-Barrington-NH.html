We initially saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send signals, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
