<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, however not suitable with IP cameras.
