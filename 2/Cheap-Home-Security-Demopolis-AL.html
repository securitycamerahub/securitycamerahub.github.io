<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smartphone notifies with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
