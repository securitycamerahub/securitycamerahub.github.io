<p>There are two primary kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet protocol (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras.

<p>Resolution: This is one of the most crucial considerations when picking a camera. For a sharp image, you'll want a camera that can shoot at least in 720p hd, which means an IP camera.

<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly fee for a set amount of time, normally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-lasting plan, are ending up being more common. These systems often cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount in exchange for that lengthy service arrangement. Spending for the equipment in advance offers you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and start service as often times as you desire.</p>
