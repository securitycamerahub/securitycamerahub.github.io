<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
