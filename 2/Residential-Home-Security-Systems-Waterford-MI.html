<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).
