<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
