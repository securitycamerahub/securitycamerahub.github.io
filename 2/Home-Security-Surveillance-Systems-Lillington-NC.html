<p>The authorities department asked the city board to deal with the issue regarding the amount of police resources being used on incorrect alarm system. The ordinance was amended and entered into impact on June 1, 2013. Just like Vizzini's overuse of impossible" in The Princess Bride, home security companies like to toss around the word wireless" quite easily. We get it.

<p>Consider it by doing this, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more sophisticated video camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars?
