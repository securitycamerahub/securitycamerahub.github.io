<p>The authorities department asked the city board to deal with the issue regarding the amount of police resources being used on incorrect alarm system. The ordinance was amended and entered into impact on June 1, 2013. Just like Vizzini's overuse of impossible" in The Princess Bride, home security companies like to toss around the word wireless" quite easily. We get it.
