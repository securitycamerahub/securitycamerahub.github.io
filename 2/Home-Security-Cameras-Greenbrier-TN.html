<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
