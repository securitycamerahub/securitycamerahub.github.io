<p>Contact among our security professionals with any questions you might have about home alarm monitoring. While it might come as a surprise, burglar alarms have actually been around for over 150 years. In fact, the second half of the 19th century was a duration of great development in the security industry. The first home alarm was patented in 1853 by a Bostonian innovator called Augustus Russell Pope.</p>
<p>This self monitored alarm has four smart modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Private. Based upon that, the camera switches on or off depending upon your location. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree large angle lens that decreases all blind areas and offers you access to a larger field of vision than many cameras.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send smart device alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
