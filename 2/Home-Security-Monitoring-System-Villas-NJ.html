Techniques included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV evaluation study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV assessments, and getting in touch with leading researchers to inquire about forthcoming assessments. Both published and unpublished reports were consisted of in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was global in scope.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to go with a DIY system or go with a professionally installed system, you'll have to pay a yearly or month-to-month cost if you need monitoring, and sometimes, you'll be hit with a month-to-month charge to settle the cost of hardware components. With most Do It Yourself systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Set, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can avoid any monthly costs if you choose to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, costs will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. If you commit to a three-year contract, the price of the Nest service drops to $19 monthly. Ring's Protect Plus plan chooses $10 per month and does not need an agreement.</p>
