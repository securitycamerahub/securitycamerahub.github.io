<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it records a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notices and live views were painfully slow, and the range is bad.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition.

Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
