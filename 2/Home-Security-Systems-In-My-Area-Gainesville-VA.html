However it is very important that you understand the basic rundown of the industry leaders. We're talking brand names like SimpliSafe, Frontpoint, Vivint, ADT, Deep Sentinel, House Security, Ring Alarm, Protect America, Nest Secure, and finally, Brinks Home Security.

<p>The Residence Smart Security Set, our previous runner-up, is still a strong option for some people. House has upgraded that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which supplies a much better range for sensing units. Both the initial Home system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only model we tested that also works with HomeKit. We have actually experienced a few technical concerns while long-term screening the Home Iota, therefore will continue to check and update appropriately. We no longer suggest it.</p>
