<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
