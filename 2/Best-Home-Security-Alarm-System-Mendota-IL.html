<p>The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a great daytime image.

<p>There's less time and difficulty included when it comes to installation if you opt for a wireless surveillance system.

We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
