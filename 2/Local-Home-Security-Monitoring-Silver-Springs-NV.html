<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
