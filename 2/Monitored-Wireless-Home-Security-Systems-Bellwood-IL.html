<p>Some people would rather pay an alarm company the monthly monitoring rate rather of buying a self-monitored security system.

<p>The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's left to the company's courteous, educated professionals. Our tester felt that the pro who installed his Vivint system was courteous, timely, and honest (even decreasing his bill after realizing they didn't need to install one camera).
