When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut.

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred.

If there are no as-built files offering performance and setup info to make this combination work, there are just 2 choices.

The other technique is to rip and replace, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
