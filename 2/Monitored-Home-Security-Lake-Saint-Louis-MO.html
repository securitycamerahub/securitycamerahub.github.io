<h2>Storage Optimization Of Video Surveillance From CCTV Camera Lake Saint Louis</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system generally included several cameras linked-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which tape-recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor.
