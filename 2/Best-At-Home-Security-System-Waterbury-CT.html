<p>Many video surveillance cameras, in any classification, provide audio capabilities. This function can be one-way, where, in addition to the video images, the gadget provides accompanying audio surveillance. It can also be two-way audio, which offers not just the capability to monitor the video and audio but also a method of supplying audio direction through the camera or its accessory speaker.

As facilities, sensors and wiring need to be placed inside the walls, which includes drilling and connecting sensing units to low-voltage wires, so there's specialist labor to consider. Uninstalling, re-installing a system and moving is especially problematic and generally inadvisable, since it implies putting old hardware in a new location.</p>
<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
