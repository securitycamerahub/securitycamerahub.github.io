The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers call into question the suitability of the current trend in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or 4 free false alarms per calendar year, because they provide no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
