<h3>Home Video Security Systems Niagara Falls NY 14304</h3>

<p>Among the top home security service providers since getting in the business in 1992, Protect America offers service for numerous thousands of consumers around the United States and Canada. They offer flexibility in their equipment and offered strategies, enabling property owners to select the security solution that best matches their needs. Regrettably, there are some disadvantages to Secure America indicated by their low C- rating from BBB. A majority of the problems center around false information concerning the necessary 3 year agreement. In fact, most customers were not conscious they were making such a long term commitment. This, paired with the severe penalty for premature cancellation-100% of the staying balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may offer some pause in selecting Protect America as their home security option.</p>
