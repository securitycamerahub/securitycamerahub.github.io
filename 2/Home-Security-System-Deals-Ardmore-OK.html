<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
