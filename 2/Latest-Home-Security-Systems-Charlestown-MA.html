<p>Catastrophe security gadgets consist of things like smoke detector, carbon monoxide gas (CO) sensors, and flood sensors. Essentially, anything that alerts you if your house is in danger of an ecological concern, like fire or water damage. The Maximus Smart Security Light puts a camera right under an ordinary-looking porch light. It's not completely hidden-- it's easy enough to see if you're searching for it-- but passersby are less most likely to discover the Maximus than, state, the Ring Floodlight Webcam.</p>
