<h2>Smart Security Wireless Camera Pelham</h2>

With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights during the night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like.

The previous, more affordable variation of the outdoor Nest camera is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have actually a cable attached however, rather than working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit simpler to mess up for potential burglars.
