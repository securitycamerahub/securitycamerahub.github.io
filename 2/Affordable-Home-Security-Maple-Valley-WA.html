<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". According to a report published by the Urban Institute, cops departments across the country respond to millions of incorrect alarms from citizen and business security systems every year. This costs cities and towns millions of dollars in squandered cops resources. The Vivint Smart Home security system is easy and trusted to use, but pricey and eccentric unless you want the convenience of a pro install and upkeep.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems normally do not included in advance fees. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
