<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the whole family will like. But for everyone who enjoys ADT, it seems like there's somebody who's had a terrible experience. Part of that is because ADT has more clients than many brand names-- which indicates it has more chances to run into issues. However part of it is the way ADT sells its equipment. When a company deals with several dealers and companies, its customers are going to get a broad series of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a house owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a community feline, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

<p>Whether you decide to opt for a Do It Yourself system or select a professionally installed system, you'll need to pay a month-to-month or annual  cost if you need monitoring, and in many cases, you'll be hit with a month-to-month charge to settle the cost of hardware parts. With a lot of DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Set, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you purchase the hardware outright and can prevent any regular monthly charges if you choose to self-monitor. If you include monitoring, fees will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. If you dedicate to a three-year contract, the price of the Nest service drops to $19 each month. Ring's Protect Plus strategy chooses $10 per month and doesn't require a contract.</p>
