<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop.
