<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which could be a cost effective alternative for consumers in rural areas. We suggest cellular systems since they're much more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, however you'll pay a little bit more if you want to add extra features, like a security camera. While a typical agreement runs 42 months (among the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who wish to lease their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement.</p>
