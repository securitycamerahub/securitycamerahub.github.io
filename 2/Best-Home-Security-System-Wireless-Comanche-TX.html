<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the deck by a certified electrician (who occurs to be my hubby).
