<p>When you are on the hunt for a video security system everything depends upon your security needs. If you're a store owner, you may desire basic indoor cube cameras, together with a plug-and-play NVR to tape, view, and handle your video. You may be looking for one of our home security camera systems that have 4 outdoor bullet cameras to secure the perimeter of your home if you're a house owner.

Nevertheless, you will have to spend for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) monthly, and this doesn't come with professional monitoring. This extra cost isn't perfect, but when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices per month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal. </p>
