<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
