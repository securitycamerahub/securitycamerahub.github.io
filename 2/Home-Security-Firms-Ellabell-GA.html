<p>Security: There have actually been plenty of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, baby screens, and other Wi-Fi devices to spy on people, so make sure to examine what actions has each manufacturer taken to remove this problem. Try to find a camera that supports up-to-date wireless security protocols, such as WPA2, and make certain it encrypts internet transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never ever install a security camera (or a router or any other gadget on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
