Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month.

<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. If catching video in the dark is a priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
