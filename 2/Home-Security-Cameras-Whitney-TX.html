It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost two years of night, day and usage images have constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we experienced when checking the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.

Thankfully, there are numerous systems on the marketplace that give house owners the power to self-monitor, which indicates they can monitor their own home.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
