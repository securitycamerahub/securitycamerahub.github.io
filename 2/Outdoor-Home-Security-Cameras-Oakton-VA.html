<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out smart device signals with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
