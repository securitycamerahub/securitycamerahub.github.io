<p>The cover of darkness isn't adequate to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a bit of a problem is in between taping and discovering motion.

<p>The Ring Alarm also has a self-monitoring alternative, something that's unheard of among professionally installed systems. That implies even if you don't pay the regular monthly cost, the system will still inform you through your smartphone if it finds a hazard, however you are responsible for calling emergency services such as the authorities or fire department-- so your phone needs to stay on and you need to be willing to field notifies, even at 2:00 a.m. It's good that the system has a monitoring alternative, though, in case you do not constantly desire that responsibility, such as when you're on holiday.</p>
