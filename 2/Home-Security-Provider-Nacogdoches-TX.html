<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
